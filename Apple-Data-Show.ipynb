    "\n",
    "The project in its current state is of purely an exploratory nature, using only 2000 possible utterances that I have fabricated for the purpose of this exercise, I have them in Italian(not Latin) as to not distract from the code.\n",

    "This is done in three sections:\n",
    "1: Matching intent(or slots, or ASR strings) and TTS\n",
    "2: Using data points like confidence and city to triangulate against one intent, in this case hours\n",
    "3: Use NaiveBayes ML models to use the words in the questions themselves to pull out signals\n",

    "Conclusion of first goal: This process needs to be refined and needs to be bucketized per intent, however, the picture given is certainly useful and could elaborated extensively.  The idea here would be to create a system of pairs using Regex: on one side, the presence of a slot(PlaceType, PlaceName, etc.), intent and ASR to ascertain the content type the customer is looking to consume.  In this case we can determine that if the answer has hours in it, then the customer will have at least received the type of content they're looking for.  In a later iteration we could look for signals such as distance between customer and Point of Interest(POI), whether or not the POI is a Chain, parse out category searches(restaurant, coffee shop, etc.) to get an even clearer idea of whether or not the pair succeeded.  For local search (looking for POIs or services close to the user) we could create the following buckets with this automated process:\n",

    "This is a mix of buckets, so most of the top words make sense, but not all of them.  Two of our top words are \"dim\"(part of the word \"dimmi\" or \"tell me\") and \"dam\"(part of the word \"dammi\" or \"give me\").  This tells us that our ASR is systematically separating those words into two sounds.  Those partial words occur in a large number of questions, so we need to make sure our models can understand that word separation and that no ranking errors are created.  We can also get an idea of distribution of questions between telephone, address, and hours in general.  The exact same code could be run on TTS to see if the two correspond, i.e. if the instances of key words denoting hours, and those that give hours are around the same in number and percentage of total utterances."

It would also be better to try with different types of models, nearest neighbor models for example.  Here, we principally use key words form questions to query in order to gage the predictive value of the words themselves. Our data set is small, just 2000 utterances, and this exercise is just exploratory in nature.\n"
